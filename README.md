# Foreword
I just stumbled into this ancient repo and found this game I wrote 6 years ago for a school project.
It goes way beyond what was asked...

I don't know how I feel about this to be honest. I am pretty proud to have written this at 17. I mean the codes not exactly nice, who knows why I implemented my own LinkedList. But I still think its a pretty impressive effort to write a complete game in C++ at that age (in supposingly 4 days? wtf...) without any mentoring.

At the same time I'm a little ashamed that I knew C++ (the fundemetals at least). I mean shouldn't I have been getting drunk and trying out drugs around then? I was a pretty weird kid, guess I'm still a pretty weird guy.
